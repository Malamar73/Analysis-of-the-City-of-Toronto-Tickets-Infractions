This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
temp <- tempfile()

download.file("http://opendata.toronto.ca/revenue/parking/ticket/parking_tickets_2008.zip",temp)
P2008<-(read.csv(unzip(temp), fileEncoding = "UTF-16", quote = "",    stringsAsFactors = FALSE))
```


```{r}
total_revenue<-sqldf('SELECT SUM(revenue) as total_revenue FROM All_Year_rev ')
total_revenue
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
